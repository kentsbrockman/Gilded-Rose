# Gilded Rose

Here's a project meant to practice refactoring and clean code, conducted during [The Hacking Project](https://www.thehackingproject.org/) bootcamp.

The given context is the **implementation of an inventory management system** for a shop that sells a variety of products.

At the very beginning, we received a [grotesque pile of nested ifs](https://github.com/mtbrault/GildedRoseTHP/blob/master/src/gilded_rose.js) to work with.

So, I've come up with a system that spread the scopes of the code into different files.

Besides, as the products have very different characteristics, I've used **Object-oriented programming with classes, class inheritance and class methods** to fit in the context.

Finally, [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) has been installed for **unit testing purposes**. You can check that out in `spec/gilded_rose_spec.js`.
